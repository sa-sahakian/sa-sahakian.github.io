# Ansible Playbooks - Part2

- Ansible playbooks:

Playbook is single YAML file which contain set of plays which defines a set of activities or tasks to be run on the a single host or multiple host servers.
Some of these tasks are:

1. Execute commands
2. Run scripts
3. Install packages
4. Manage host operating systems 

The playbook runs from top to bottom each task in order, a playbook can contain multiple plays which they orchestrate multiple machines (hosts). We can use strategies to control the default behavior. 

- How to run  playbooks?

To run playbooks we will need to use the following command:

` ansible-playbook <playbookname.yml>`

Using following flag to see detail outputs:

` ansible-playbook <playbookname.yml> --verbose`


- How to verify the playbooks?

We have following options to verify the playbook:

`--check`

`--diff`

`--list-hosts`

`list-tasks`

`--syntax-check`

We can use `ansible-lint` for more detail and feedback on the playboos before executing them. 

`ansible-lint playbooksname.yml`

To see the description of each error:

`ansible-lint default rules playbooksname.yml`
