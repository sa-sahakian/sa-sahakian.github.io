# This a qucik tutorial to use and work with GitHub in VS Code. (Part1)#
Note: this is a qucik guide line from "https://code.visualstudio.com/"

- How to start?

To get started with the GitHub in VS Code, you'll need to create an account and install the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension then login. 

After login, if you are not redirected to VS Code, you can add your authorization token manually. In the browser window, you will receive your authorization token. Copy the token, and switch back to VS Code. Select Signing in to github.com... in the Status bar, paste the token, and hit Enter.

- How to clone a repository?

You can search for and clone a repository from GitHub using the Git: Clone command in the Command Palette (⇧⌘P) or by using the Clone Repository button in the Source Control view (available when you have no folder open).

- How to Authenticating with an existing repository?

Enabling authentication through GitHub happens when you run any Git action in VS Code that requires GitHub authentication, such as pushing to a repository that you're a member of or cloning a private repository. You don't need to have any special extensions installed for authentication; it is built into VS Code so that you can efficiently manage your repository.
