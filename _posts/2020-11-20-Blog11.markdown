# Multi-Processing Modules (MPMs)

It is a core module of Apache. MPM handle important core tasks such as creating network connections (binding to ports), listening for and accepting requests from clients (browsers) and creating child processes or threads to handle the requests. Because these core tasks must be handled the same way for every request, you can only have one MPM loaded at the time. EasyApache 4 prevents the installation of more than one MPM concurrently.

At the end of the startup phase, after the configuration has been read, after the configuration has been read, Apacheâ€™s general control is passed to a process management module i.e. Multi-Processing Module.
One MPM is an interface between the running Apache server and underlying OS. Its main role is to optimize Apache according to the platform on which the server is running.

- Extending the modular design to this level of the server allows two important benefits:

1. Apache httpd can more cleanly and efficiently support a wide variety of operating systems. In particular, the Windows version of the server is now much more efficient, since `mpm_winnt` can use native networking features in place of the POSIX layer used in Apache httpd 1.3. This benefit also extends to other operating systems that implement specialized MPMs.

2. The server can be better customized for the needs of the particular site. For example, sites that need a great deal of scalability can choose to use a threaded MPM like `worker` or `event`, while sites requiring stability or compatibility with older software can use a prefork.
At the user level, MPMs appear much like other Apache httpd modules. The main difference is that one and only one MPM must be loaded into the server at any time. The list of available MPMs appears on the module index page.


- Building an MPM as a static module:

MPMs can be built as static modules on all platforms. A single MPM is chosen at build time and linked into the server. The server must be rebuilt in order to change the MPM.

To override the default MPM choice, use the `--with-mpm=NAME` option of the configure script. NAME is the name of the desired MPM.

Once the server has been compiled, it is possible to determine which MPM was chosen by using ./httpd -l. This command will list every module that is compiled into the server, including the MPM.

- Building an MPM as a DSO module:

On Unix and similar platforms, MPMs can be built as DSO modules and dynamically loaded into the server in the same manner as other DSO modules. Building MPMs as DSO modules allows the MPM to be changed by updating the LoadModule directive for the MPM instead of by rebuilding the server.

`LoadModule mpm_prefork_module modules/mod_mpm_prefork.so`

Attempting to LoadModule more than one MPM will result in a startup failure with the following error.

`AH00534: httpd: Configuration error: More than one MPM loaded.`

This feature is enabled using the `--enable-mpms-shared` option of the configure script. With argument all, all possible MPMs for the platform will be installed. Alternately, a list of MPMs can be specified as the argument.

The default MPM, either selected automatically or specified with the `--with-mpm` option of the configure script, will be loaded in the generated server configuration file. Edit the LoadModule directive to select a different MPM.
