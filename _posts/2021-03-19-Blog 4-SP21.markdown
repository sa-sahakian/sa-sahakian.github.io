# Terraform (Part4)

- Terraform Block:
The terraform {} block is required so Terraform knows which provider to download from the Terraform Registry.

terraform {

  required_providers {

    aws = {

      source  = "hashicorp/aws"

      version = "~> 3.27"

    }

  }

}

Note: The `hashicorp/aws` is shorhand for `registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws`.
