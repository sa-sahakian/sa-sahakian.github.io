# Terraform (Part3)
Note: this is a qucik guide line from "learn.hashicorp.com"

- Prerequisites:
1. An AWS accounts
2. AWS CLI installed
3. AWS credentials configured

Note: Find the AWS access key and Secret access key from AWS portal. 

After entering the requested information configuration process creates a file `~/.aws/credentials` or `%UserProfile%\.aws\credentials`

- Write Configuration:
We will need to create `Configuration` to write the configuration to lunch a single AWS EC2 instance.

To do this, we will first create a directory and create a file to hold the configuration code. 

` touch main.tf`

- Here is the sample configuration code to create a single EC2:

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 3.27"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  profile = "default"
  region  = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-830c94e3"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleInstance"
  }
}
