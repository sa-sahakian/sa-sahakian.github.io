# Packet Filter Part 2 - FreeBSD

# How to manage Packet Filter:

To manage the rules in packet filter we have to create rulesets and configure it then identify the path in the `rc.conf` file. 

Note: there are some sample rulesets in `/usr/share/examples/pf/`


# PF ruleset:

- To create a minimal ruleset, we will need to edit `/etc/pf.conf` file and add the following lines:

`block in all` 

`pass out all keep state`

This is a minimal ruleset which will allow a single machine to to be connected to one network (internet).
The firs line will block all the incoming traffics by default and second rule will allows connections created by the single machine to pass out. 

Note: After making any changes in the ruleset, we will need to be loaded by using the follwoing command:

`# pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf`


- PF provides lists and macros which can be defined for use when creating rules. Macros can include lists and need to be defined before use.

`tcp_services = "{ ssh, smtp, domain, www, pop3, auth, pop3s }"`

`udp_services = "{ domain }"`

Note: this list needs to be loaded at the very top section of the rules sets. 


- PF understands port names as well as port numbers, as long as the names are listed in `/etc/services`. 

For example we can create a list and mentioning the services names which we would like to allow or denied.

`tcp_services = "{ ssh, smtp, domain, www, pop3, auth, pop3s }"`

`udp_services = "{ domain }"`

`block all`

`pass out proto tcp to any port $tcp_services keep state`

`pass proto udp to any port $udp_services keep state`

Note: 
a. As I mentioned we have to keep the list on the top of the ruleset
b. The fist line contains the TCP ports (services' names) which  needs to be allowed
c. b. The fist line contains the UDP ports (services' names) which  needs to be allowed
