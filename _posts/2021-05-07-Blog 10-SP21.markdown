# Terraform (Part10)

- Apply the Configuration:

After validating the configuration by running `terraform validate` we will need to run `terraform apply`. 
This will display the execution plan and discribe which action terraform will take inorder to change real infrustructure to match the configuration. 

Note: Some of the valuse are know but some won't be known until the resource is created. 

Now, Terraform will wait for the confirmation `yes` to confirm the process and execute the plan. 

- Inspecting the state:
After applying the configuration the data will be saved in `terraform.tfstate`. This is an important file and needs to be saved in a secure place. 
to inspect the current state we can use `terraform show`.
