# Custome Kernel - FreeBSD

- What is Kernel?
    Kernel is the core of the operating system which is responsible for:

        . Memory and process management
        . Enforcing security controls
        .  Networking
        . Disk access
        . Scheduling
        . Interprocess communication

- Different types of Kernels:

        . Monolithic
        . Micro
        . Hybrid
        . Nano
        . Exo

- Why do we need to customized Kernels?

. Support specific range of hardware
. Faster boot time
. Lower the memory usage
. Increase the security

- How to customized the kernel in FreeBSD?

. Step 1
    Back up the kernel in the following directory:

`#cp -Rp /boot/kernel/ /boot/kernel.backup`

. Step 2:
    Built the custom Kernel by going to the following directory and duplicate the kernel and modify it:

`## cd /usr/src/sys/amd64/conf`

`# cp GENERIC <MYKERNEL>`

Step 3: 
    Compile the customized Kernel by going to th efollowing directory:

`# cd /usr/src`

`# make buildkernel KERNCONF=MYKERNEL`

Step 4:
    Install the Kernel while we are in the last directory:

`# make installkernel KERNCONF=MYKERNEL`

Step 5:
    Reboot and load the OS with the new Kernel.
